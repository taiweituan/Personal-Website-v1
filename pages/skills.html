    <h3>AngularJS</h3>
    <p>Steep learn curve, complicate, but powerful JavaScript framework caught my IT head of current employer's attention. Always two-way binding feature gives the web page the most robust, interactive user interface and user experience that any other JavaScript frameworks can provide. AJAX manipulation.</p>
    <p><b>This web site is built using AngularJS with Material Design.</b></p>
    <h3>jQuery</h3>
    <p>Before we started using AngularJS, jQuery was my primary language as long as making interactive web pages. For me, it is essentially a easy-to-use JavaScript in general and has amazing built-in functions that makes a dynamic web page and creating animation incredibly easy.</p>
    <h3>Python</h3>
